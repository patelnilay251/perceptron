# Perceptron Simulation

This repository contains a Python implementation of a simple perceptron model. The simulation software allows users to create a perceptron with customizable inputs, weights, biases, and activation functions. It includes training and testing functionalities for a basic neural network.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to set up and run the simulation on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/perceptron.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd perceptron

3. Run the simulation script:
   
   ```bash
   python main.py

5. Follow the prompts to input the number of inputs, weights, biases, and their respective values.

6. The program will calculate the output based on the Perceptron model.
